				Massage Therapy is one type of Manual Therapy, focussing on the soft tissues of the body.
				Muscles, ligaments and tendons are treated with manual techniques in order to remove pain 
				and tension, release stress, increase blood flow and support tissue repair.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Sports and Remedial Massage comprises the application of several specific techniques, using firm pressure and 
				targeting defined areas, impacting even the deep layers of the muscles. 
				Therefore it has a therapeutic effect and enables lasting improvement of the respective condition.
				
				With regular use of Massage Therapy the body will become more resilient to stress and strains and less vulnerable to
				injuries while athletic performance can be improved. Injuries will heal faster producing less scar tissue and 
				dysfunctions can be removed.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Massage is a 100% natural way of healing, without use of drugs, chemicals or
				technical appliances. It is completely free of side effects, sustainable and ecological.

			<h2 class="paper__heading text-center">Who will benefit from Massage?</h2>

			<p>
				Massage Therapy is known to be beneficial for athletes and people who are regularly exercising. 
				But equally it is highly effective for individuals with a physically challenging occupation, those carrying out 
				repetitive movements or people who are physically inactive, for example desk workers. 
				Painful tension, shortened muscles and ligaments, stiffness, decreased range of movement, lack of
				flexibility and poor circulation are often a result of these routines, which can build up over time and lead to
				serious long term issues like chronic pain, bad posture or damage of muscle fibres if left untreated. 
				Massage Therapy instantly alleviates or eliminates these conditions, keeping muscles and tissues healthy and
				preventing long term damage.
