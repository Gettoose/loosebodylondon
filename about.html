			<p class="Info">
				Sports Massage is a type of Manual Therapy. Muscles and other soft tissues like ligaments and tendons are manually 
				manipulated in order to remove pain and tension, release stress, increase blood flow and support tissue repair.
				Sports Massage uses firm pressure and targets specific areas, impacting even the deep layers of the muscles. 
				This enables a therapeutic effect and sustainable improvement of the respective condition.
				
				With regular use of Sports Massage the body will become more resilient to stress and strains and less vulnerable to
				injuries while athletic performance can be improved.
			</p>

			<p>While Sports Massage is the term labeling the technique, <b>Remedial Massage</b> is the application of the technique
				in order to heal any kind of pain, discomfort, injury or dysfunction of the soft tissues.
			</p>

			<p>Sports and Remedial Massage is a 100% natural way of healing, without requiring drugs, chemicals or
				technical appliances, it is completely free of side effects, sustainable and ecological.

			<h2 class="paper__heading text-center">Who will benefit from Sports Massage?</h2>

			<p>
				Despite what the name might suggest everyone can benefit from Sports Massage. Not only highly
				efficient for athletes and people who are physically active, it is also for individuals with a physically
				challenging occupation, those carrying out repetitive movements or people who are inactive, sitting at a desk
				all day. Painful tension, shortened muscles and ligaments, stiffness, decreased range of movement, lack of
				flexibility and poor circulation are often a result of these routines, which can build up over time and lead to
				serious long term issues like bad posture, chronic pain or damage of the muscle if left untreated. Sports
				and Remedial massage helps to alleviate or eliminate the negative impact of these conditions and prevent long
				term damage.
